\title{emdr: Empirical mode decomposition based regression}
\description{
The \code{emdr} package provides functions to decompose time series through
empirical mode decomposition (EMD)
and use the resulting components (called intrinsic mode functions, IMFs)
in a regression analysis.
}
\details{
Functions in the package are roughly divided in three sections:

\itemize{
 \item MEMD decomposition and description of the resulting IMFs;
 \item preparing
   MIMFs being used in a regression function to predict a non-decomposed
   response variables (denoted EMD-R1);
 \item  predicting one variable's
   IMF from other variables' IMFs (denoted EMD-R2).
}
}
\section{MEMD functions}{

An analysis usually begins with a call to \code{\link{memd}} to decompose
a multivariate time-series into IMFs. This function supports different
modifications from the original algorithm, i.e. ensemble EMD and 
noise-assisted MEMD to address the issue of mode-mixing.
The result from \code{\link{memd}} is an object of class \code{mimf}
which can then be analyzed by looking at 
summarized characteristics through a call to 
\code{\link{summary.mimf}} or visually using the \code{\link{plot.mimf}}
method. Finally, \code{\link{imf.test}} performs an IMF significance test
and the method \code{\link{plot.imftest}} shows the result.
}

\section{EMD-R1}{

The EMD-R1 design regresses a non-decomposed response against predictors'
IMFs. Thus, any regression function can be used to perform EMD-R1. The
function \code{\link{pimf}} prepares a \code{mimf} object as a 
\code{data.frame} to be used in a regression function. It includes lagging
the IMFs and adding non-IMF covariates. Since several IMFs can be correlated,
it is advised to consider the Lasso regression which can be performed by
the function \code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}} in the package \code{glmnet}.
Resulting coefficients can then be standardized by the function 
\code{\link{sensitivity}} and displayed by the function 
\code{\link{plot_emdr}}.
}

\section{EMD-R2}{

In the EMD-R2 design, the response variable is also decomposed and each of 
its IMFs is regressed against predictors' IMFs of similar frequencies.
After a call to \code{\link{memd}} to jointly decompose the response and
predictors, the resulting object can be used in the function 
\code{\link{emdr2}}. the result is a list of submodels for each IMF.
The function \code{\link{extract.emdr2}} extracts any element from each
submodel with the \code{\link{coef.emdr2}} method for coefficients
specifically. As for EMD-R1, these coefficients can then be standardized by 
the function \code{\link{sensitivity}} and displayed by the function 
\code{\link{plot_emdr}}.
